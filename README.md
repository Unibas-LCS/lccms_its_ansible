# lccms_its_ansible
The its ansible roles.

The repository is used to manage the ITS provided and maintained ansible roles. Whenever a new OS version is started, a branch with the name of the current version should be created in order to maintain support for that version.
Thus, the HEAD will always be for the latest version supported by ITS.
For the initial creation of the repository, this was Ubuntu22.04LTS.
